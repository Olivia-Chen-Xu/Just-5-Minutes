# Just 5 Minutes

This project was built within 36 hours at the SuperPOSITRON hackathon.

It was the winner of the "Best Use of Google Cloud" category. 

Technologies used: `React`, `Firebase`, `Material UI`, `Figma`(for prototype)

## Description
We realized that many times we weren’t making the best use of the small fragments of time throughout our day. 

Instead of indulging in new activities and hobbies, we just simply tell ourselves that we don’t have time. 

But how many times have you caught yourself scrolling through Instagram or Twitter in between meetings or right before lunch? 

In those small fragments of time(usually 5 minutes), we carelessly spend precious minutes that could be put towards doing something far more productive.

We wanted to help break the ‘busier than we think we are’ mindset/mentality with the ‘Just 5 Minutes’ web app. 

This productivity tool is designed to help users delegate their time more wisely and act towards their personal goals instead of putting them off.
